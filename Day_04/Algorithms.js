// flowcharts are a visual way to show the work in charts etc.

//algorithm
// an algorithm is a set of ordered steps for solving a problem, allways have a start and an end when it comes to the algorithms
// why we ned to is because we need to think what we need to do before doing them, saving a lot time and before hand you can add to the algorithm, the consequences of not doing the planning beforehand (bugs, crashing the system, the audience experience with the software) it really can payoff/saving time when the project becomes more complex
// why build algorithms? the algorithms your going to build, writing it down to begin with can help sovle the ongoing challenges

// algorithms in program design, a computer program is built to sovle a problem. Example of the is calculating the grade obtained given mark, a program to produce a doctument

// the approch is to analyse the problem, people overlook this and stuggle later on, now somethimes it is revalivity straight forwards, got to really clear about the problem then you can start developing an algroithm, then ongoing a flowchart to demonstrate the flow of data through the algorithm, it is an visual repuatation to show and understand how data is moving through the program, pseudocode it is adding detail then you can start writing your algorithm in small incritments, in work showing now the problem is actually sovled in the workspace, and finally testing using jest

// flowchats
// a flowchart is a graphical representation of the sequence of opeeration in a set of instructions or algorithm, an algorithm cna be represented graphically using a flowchart, it is has been created or to be created, doing flowchart is an easier way to understand the code anf process of the software. connectors to continue onto the next page to continue the process

//pseudocode
//it is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. it is detailed yet readable, and it detailed yet readable, and it resemble the actual program that will be implemented later, however it cannot be compiled nor executed. 
// pseudocode can also help with the following: variables names, assignment of the values to the varibles, arithmetic operations used and relational operation
// the pseudocode program to calculate the area of the retangle based on user imputs.
//length- get user imput for length | width- get user input for width | area- lengthxwidth | print area | end. 
// exmaple= |start|process-set name-´let name,pw=string values´|imput-´username´|decision-´username´with 2 outputs true/false {if true}|decition-´password´ {depending if it is true or fales}|final output-correct
